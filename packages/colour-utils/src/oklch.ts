 * The boundaries are fitted to 4,275 human-named colours rather than derived.
 * Every entry in haus-colour-names whose name ends in a family word, and whose
 * previous word is not also one ("Blue Green" is nobody's evidence), is a colour
 * a person decided the family of: 1,094 Greens, 1,070 Blues, 509 Reds and so on.
 * The eight boundaries are the set that maximises mean per-family recall over
 * that data, which `hue-families.test.ts` asserts and holds at 0.77.
 *
 * They replace a set derived as the midpoints between the measured hues of the
 * eight colours the families are named after. That construction is only right if
 * a family is centred on the colour it is named after, and the data says several
 * are not. The colour called orange sits at hue 71, while the median of 222
 * colours people call orange is 47, so a midpoint at 50 put more than half of
 * them in Red. Purple was worse: its median is 312 and the bin ended at 310.
 *
 * These are not the HSL numbers either. OKLCH hue is a different wheel, and
 * reusing HSL's boundaries (red 0, yellow 60, green 120, blue 240) offsets every
 * family by roughly one place: it puts #ff0000 in Orange and #0000ff in Purple.
 *
 * Two edges are judgement rather than fit. Orange ends at 72 rather than the
 * fitted 70, because #ffa500 is at 71 and a vocabulary that cannot name the
 * colour called orange is not usable; it costs 0.002 of accuracy. And no
 * boundary separates purple from magenta: #800080 and #ff00ff are both at hue
 * 328 and differ only in lightness and chroma. 328 is Purple here, because far
 * more real colours at that hue are called purple than magenta.
