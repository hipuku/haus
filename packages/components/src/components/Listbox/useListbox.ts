/**
 * The keyboard half of the WAI-ARIA listbox pattern, for a button that opens a
 * panel of options.
 *
 * Moved into haus with `haus#61`. It arrived here from core, whose copy said it
 * was 'ported alongside vault's `useListbox`, with the same signature, so the
 * two stay diffable until one of them moves to haus'. This is that move. Two
 * products wrote the same keyboard contract and neither should own it.
 *
 * Focus stays on the trigger the whole time and the highlighted option is
 * announced through `aria-activedescendant`, which is what lets the options be
 * plain `<li role='option'>` rather than buttons: `role='option'` has to be a
 * direct child of the listbox, so any element that can hold DOM focus in
 * between makes the structure invalid.
 *
 * Arrows, Home and End move; Enter and Space commit; a printable key jumps to
 * the next option starting with what has been typed, wrapping so repeatedly
 * pressing one letter cycles through the options beginning with it. Escape and
 * outside-dismissal are deliberately not here: both components that use this
 * already own them, and one of them shares that ownership with every other
 * popover in its app.
 *
 * Ported alongside vault's `useListbox`, with the same signature, so the two
