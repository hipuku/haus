/**

 * The meodai colour-names dataset: 31,900 hex values with a human name each.

 *
 * Pair it with `createNamedColourMatcher` from haus-colour-utils:
 *
 *   import { colourNameEntries } from 'haus-colour-names'
 *   import { createNamedColourMatcher } from 'haus-colour-utils'
 *
 *   const nameColour = createNamedColourMatcher(colourNameEntries())
 *   nameColour('#4f84ba')  // [{ name: 'Blue Vault', hex: '#4e83bd', distance: 0.7 }, …]
